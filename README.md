# cordova-plugin-memphis-background-geolocation

## Description

Cross-platform geolocation for Cordova / PhoneGap with battery-saving "circular region monitoring" and "stop detection".

Forked from [cordova-background-geolocation-plugin](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation/blob/master/PROVIDERS.md) for the original plugin

The plugin was forked to make changes to the background location syncing. We save the data in firebase and do not want it stored as an array. 

Feel free to use the plugin if you needs are the same.
